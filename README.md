# Story-Based-Game
Story based interactive game with audio and images to assist the player.
This project is an audio and Images based game created using Twine. The game consists of a series of interconnected passages, or "pages," that the player can navigate through by clicking on links within the text. The game also uses a number of CSS styles, such as animations and transitions, to enhance the player's experience.
(Profanity Warning)
The game is just a joke, and in no way reprents who I am
and its sole purpose is entertainment.
Made with Twine Engine.
